## Title
EMK: Episodic Memory Kernel - A Minimalist Storage Primitive for AI Agent Experience

## Authors

## Abstract
We present EMK (Episodic Memory Kernel), a lightweight, immutable storage layer for AI agent experiences. As autonomous agents become increasingly prevalent, the need for structured, queryable memory of past actions and outcomes becomes critical. EMK provides a minimalist yet powerful primitive that captures the complete agent experience cycle—Goal → Action → Result → Reflection—in an append-only ledger with O(1) write complexity and O(n) retrieval with optional vector similarity search. We demonstrate that EMK achieves 0.036ms episode creation latency (27,694 ops/sec) and 652 write ops/sec throughput while maintaining full audit trails, making it suitable for production agent systems. Unlike existing agent memory systems that conflate storage with summarization, EMK provides a clean separation of concerns, enabling higher-level memory architectures to be built on a solid foundation.
